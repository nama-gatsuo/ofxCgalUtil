## 0. About CGAL
* The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)
  * build binaries along with the instruction [here](https://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html).
    * For now, this addon uses CGAL of x64 without Qt.
    * For compiling, Boost must be needed. openFrameworks also uses boost. To avoid conflict from difference of version or from duplication, replacing all file of lib in oF directory is recommended.
* Boost
  * Common but huge template library. CGAL has dependency on it.
  * It may be simpler to download binaries from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/) than to build from source by yourself.
  * openFrameworks itself also has the dependency on boost only for file-io which isn't sufficient to compile CGAL.

## 1. Build your project
* Locate CGAL files into `ofxCgalUtil\lib\`
  ```
  lib
    L CGAL-4.14
      L auxiliary
        L gmp
          L include   // locate files in CGAL-4.14\auxiliary\gmp\include
          L lib       // locate files in CGAL-4.14\auxiliary\gmp\lib
      L include       // locate files in CGAL-4.14\include
      L lib           // locate files in CGAL-4.14\lib
      L bin           // locate files in CGAL-4.14\bin
  ```
* Replace boost libs and includes in `of_root\libs\boost` with files of the same version that you used to build CGAL.
* Using Project Generator(PG), update your oF project directory.
* If using Debug mode, you will need to set `\bigobj` option for compilation since CGAL and boost has so many template functions which will cause [exceeding the limitation of .obj files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1128?view=vs-2019).
  * `properties(configuration: Debug)` > `C/C++` > `All Options` > `Additional Options`, type `/bigobj`.
